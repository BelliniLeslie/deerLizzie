Deer Linnéa, 
 <div></div>
<div>I have never been the best with many things and most of the time, when I'm with you, my words fail me  </div>
<div>Sometimes I wish I could be more poetic and say things you never hear </div>
<div>But words are meaningless compared to the things you make me feel </div>
<div>None of them is fitting, none of them feels real </div>
<div></div>
<div>At first, I wanted to make a small animation for you on the theme of one of your favourite fairytales... 
then I remembered that I don't know how to draw. </div>
<div></div>
<div> I also wanted to write you a song...  </div>
<div>Then thought to myself that it was probably a bit too much. Even coming from me  </div>
<div></div>
<div>And finally, as I began to question whether I would find something perfect for you I thought to myself... why not destroying one of her favourite fairytails?  </div>
<div></div>
 <div>Little disclaimer: I'm making fun of this fairytail but the truth is <i>I luv it</i> </div>
 
<h2>Schneeweisschen und Rosenrot 2.0</h2>

<div>Once upon a dream ,there was a happy family with twin sisters named Schneeweißchen and Rosenrot. </div>
<div>Their parents didn’t know what to call their little girls </div>
<div>until one beautiful autumn morning, when the breeze danced around their skin and the smell of splendid roses intoxicated their noses. </div>
</div>
<div>Their parents considered them as the best gift life could have ever offered. </div>
<div>They were lovely little girls with the most adorable giggles on earth. </div>
<div>Schneeweißchen and Rosenrot were very close and always looked out for each other. They were different but complemented each other perfectly. </div>
<div>Their connection was otherworldly, and many envied it but never found its equal. </div>

<div></div> 

<div>As they grew up and began their own lives, they still went out together, going to bars or discovering castles not so far from their homes. </div>
<div>Everyone in the village knew them and always found excuses to talk to them whenever they were around. </div>

<div></div> 

<div>They cherished their houses dearly and, when the season allowed it, they would pick red and white roses to decorate their homes from their favourite tree when one winter night in March... </div>

<div>“Schneeweißchen, lock the door, will you?” their mother said before sitting next to the fireplace. She put her glasses on and began storytelling a fairytale to her daughters when someone knocked on the door. </div>

<div>“Go get the door, Rosenrot,” the mother said. “A man may need shelter.” Rosenrot opened the door and found a giant giraffe on the other side. Distraught, she threw herself behind her mother’s seat, and Schneeweißchen hid under the bed. </div>

<div>“What are you scared of?” the giraffe asked. “I don’t want to harm anyone; I am just very cold.” </div>

<div>“Come, my poor giraffe,” the mother said. “Come sleep next to the fire. Schneeweißchen, Rosenrot, come out of your hiding spots, you frightened little things.” Once the daughters calmed down, they got closer. </div>

<div>“Dear young ladies, help me get this snow off of me,” the giraffe asked. With a brush, they began taking care of her, which made her stretch and moan with pleasure (innocently). After losing their fear, the two sisters laughed at their new friend's behaviour. 
 <div>The giraffe’s skin was warm, and whenever they tickled her, she laughed out loud and said, “Don’t kill your friend.”</div>

<div>When bedtime came, the mother said to the giraffe, “Stay here if you want to, next to the fireplace. It is too cold outside.” </div>
<div></div>
 <div></div>
 

<div>First thing in the morning, she went back to the city where she came from. As the days went by, the giraffe returned at the same time every day. The daughters stopped locking the door after some time as a little routine until the giraffe arrived and would play with her for hours. </div>

 <div>When spring showed the tip of its nose, the flowers and trees bloomed again. It was now time for the giraffe to say goodbye to her friends and return to her country for the summer. </div>

<div>“Why is that?” Schneeweißchen asked. </div>

<div>“So I can prevent the bad man from stealing my treasure. During winter, men are not interested in what I’m wearing, but as soon as they are, they steal everything from us, and what they take, we can never find again.” Schneeweißchen and Rosenrot accepted their despair. As the giraffe walked out the door, she got her skin scratched by it. Rosenrot thought she saw gold under her skin, but the giraffe ran away. </div>

<div>A few weeks later, while the daughters were buying clothes in the city, they met a man whose shirt got stuck in his car door. He tried to reach for his car keys on the floor but they were too far from him. </div>

<div>“Why are you looking at me like that? Help me,” he said to the girls. </div>

<div>“What are you doing here?” asked Rosenrot, not liking his tone. </div>

<div>“Stupid and curious girl. I was about to go out to see my buddies, walked out of the car, laced my shoes, went back to the car, and closed the door on my shirt. My keys must have fallen from my pocket when I kneeled. I would kneel before you, but you see, I’m still stuck,” he replied with a smirk. </div>

<div>Rosenrot, too kind for her own good, turned around, picked up the keys, and handed them to the man. He freed himself and faced the ladies again. “It would be a shame not to ask you out, right?” he said, handing her his number on a piece of paper. The twins secretly wished they would never see him again, but life has its own sense of humour. </div>

 <div></div>
 <div></div>

<div>A few days later, they met him again while he was fishing. </div>

<div>“Hey girls, looking good today. It would be a shame not to ask if you’re free for a good time now,” he asked, approaching the twins. </div>

<div>“Oh, good thing a disgusting man is really what we’re looking for right now,” Schneeweißchen said, rolling her eyes. </div>

<div>“Come on, you can’t tell me this,” he replied, holding his crotch, “is not a work of art.” </div>

<div>“This,” Schneeweißchen began, “is called an abomination where we’re from.” Rosenrot laughed, but the man didn’t find it funny. </div>

<div>“You stupid bitch, haven’t your parents taught you respect?” </div>

<div>“Says the one who tries to get into our pants in a disgusting way,” Rosenrot replied, before spotting a giraffe stuffed animal next to his backpack. When she reached for it, he jumped onto it and yelled, “Keep your hands off of my stuff, you stupid girl!” </div>

<div>As he screamed at the two ladies, a giraffe emerged from a nearby bush. Terrified, the man pleaded, “Don’t kill me, please. I’ll give you this stuffed animal. I’m so thin, take the two girls; they have more meat on them than I do and—” He couldn’t finish, for the giraffe had already knocked him down with her neck and thrown him into the water. The twin sisters, afraid for their lives, tried to leave, but the giraffe whispered, “Schneeweißchen, Rosenrot, ‘tis me, your friend.” </div>

<div>At the sound of the familiar voice, the young ladies turned around to see the giraffe transforming into a woman with a strange mustache. “Dang it, remind me to shave this. This stupid guy turned me into a giraffe to take my treasure. Only his disappearance would bring me back to normal. Cheh.” She turned to face Rosenrot and whispered a tiny “hi,” feeling shy now that Rosenrot could see her true self. But Rosenrot was already head over heels for her. They married, and Schneeweißchen married Alexia, one of the now human woman’s friends. </div>
